      <pre style="text-align:center; color:white; background-color:purple; font-size:30 px; font-family: cursive;">Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>And sorry I could not travel both<br> And be one traveler, long I stood<br>And looked down one as far as I could<br>To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
       
      Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>And having perhaps the better claim,<br>Though as for that the passing there<br>Had worn them really about the same,<br>

      And both that morning equally lay<br>In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>Oh, I kept the first for another day!><br>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>

      I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br>I took the one less traveled by,<br>And that has made all the difference.</pre>;
